Experiments with a tuya ir/rf remote control  [CBU and SH4]

See [this forum topic](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/topic3975921.html)

I'm trying to adapt the [official tuya driver](https://github.com/tuya/tuya-bsp-gpl-public-components/tree/main/driver_src_tuya/ty_driver/src/subg) to the cbu module using [libretiny](https://docs.libretiny.eu/).

Sending the buttons captured with the original firmware, while not 100%
reliable, works.

Receiving doesn't work yet.

I'm not working on this project anymore, please see the [tuya_rf](https://github.com/olivluca/tuya_rf) repository where I have everything working.
